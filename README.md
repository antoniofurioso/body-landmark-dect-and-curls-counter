# Body Landmarks detection + curls counter

Body #landmarks detection + left curl counter.

In this notebook I use openCV and the Media Pipe algorithm to track landmarks.

While simply logic was used to calculate the number of repetitions.

What do you think?

P.S. obviously its function can be extended to any other type of exercise 😁
